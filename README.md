# better-rest
This is my 4th project in the SwiftUI course. It predicts the optimal wake-up time using a Core ML model based on user inputs like desired wake-up time, sleep duration, and coffee intake. In this project, I learned SwiftUI components like DatePicker and Stepper and had the opportunity to practice Core ML and Create ML.
